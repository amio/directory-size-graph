Inspect disk usage with flame graph.

> After seeing Jordan Scales's article([I Peeked Into My Node_Modules Directory And You Wonâ€™t Believe What Happened Next](https://medium.com/friendship-dot-js/b89f63d21558)), I am surprised that so many people releasing package to npm so casually. I knew such a possibility but never thought it's so common. So I made this tool for catching these useless files wasting my precious SSD.

### Install

```bash
npm i -g fdu
```

### Usage

```bash
# will open a html showing current directory's disk usage
fdu

# view specified directory
fdu ~/git/a-repo
```
